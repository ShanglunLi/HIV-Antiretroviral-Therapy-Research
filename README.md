# HIV-Antiretroviral-Therapy-Research
## Introduction of myself
Shanglun Li, a undergraduate student in Penn State University, worked on this research project as a research assistant under the supervision by professor Le Bao in Penn State University from April 2017 to September 2018.  

## Abstract
In this project, we investigate the effect of treatment, age, and gender to the progression of AIDS by using CD4 data. We fit a Markov chain model, and use the Maximum Likelihood approach to estimate the transition probability matrices. Some numerical analysis are applied on the resulting transition probabilities, such as comparisons of confidence intervals of transition probabilities across different subgroups. 

## Data Description
HIV progression (often measured by CD4 counts) and death rates are key HIV indicators. The current software used by UNAIDS and 163 countries uses estimates derived from the ALPHA network, using data from Eastern and Southern Africa. It likely provides biased estimates for Asian population. We model the progression and survival of HIV/AIDS for hundred-thousands of Chinese participants. It is the largest HIV cohort study in the world, but the data has never been fully explored and analyzed by using statistical models. We estimate the transmission rates between CD4 categories and the death rate within each category in the Markov chain model, and account of the possible CD4 measurement errors. In this project, we use a subset of 3,000,000 individuals provided by National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention(NCAIDS), Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention(China CDC). The results are only for illustration purpose and should not be viewed as the offical results for China.
